# Content-Based-Image-Retrieival-
Images consist of visual components such as colour, shape and texture. These components stand as the primary basis with which images are distinguished. A content based image retrieval system uses these primary features of an image and checks similarity of the extracted features with those of the image given by the user. A group of images similar to the query image fed are obtained as a result. This paper proposes a new methodology for image retrieval using the local descriptors of an image in combination with one another. HSV histogram, Colour moments, Colour auto-correlogram, Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Wavelet transform are used to form the feature descriptor. In this work, a comparative study of various retrieval techniques by combination of features is performed. The result is tested with various distance metrics and a supervised learning algorithm, SVM is used for classification of the images because it has high retrieval efficacy.
